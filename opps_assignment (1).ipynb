        "  -> it is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design and organise softare.the main goal of OOPs is to make code more modular,reusable,and easiesr to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOPs?\n",
        "  ->A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "  it defines properties and behaviour that the created objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.what is an objects in OOP?\n",
        " ->An object is an instance of a class.when a class is defined,no memory\n",
        "   is allocated. but when you create an object,memory is allocated and the object can store data and use methods defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.what is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " -> Abstraction is hiding unnecessary deatails and showing only essential features.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Encapsulation is wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in python?\n",
        " ->Dunder methods (short to double UNDerscore methods) are special methods in python that start and end with double underscores,like__init__,__str__,__len__,etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        " -> Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and method) from another class (parent/superclass)\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " -> polymorphism means \"many forms\". in object-oriented programming,it allows one interface to be used for different underlying forms(dat types or classes).\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encopsulation achieved in python?\n",
        " -> Public name can be accessed from anywhere.\n",

        "    Private__cannot be accessed directly(name mangling).\n",

        "9.What is a constructor in python?\n",
        "-> A constructor is a special method in python used to initialize objects when a class is created.\n",
        "it sets up the initial values of the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static method in pythons?\n",
        " ->Class methods it works the class itself,not individual objects.\n",
        "  .it takes cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "  .used when you want to access or modify class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in python?\n",
        "  -> Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters ( number or type) with the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " ->Methods overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of amethod that is already defined in its parent class (superclass).\n",
        " The child class \"overrides\" the method of the parent class with its own version.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in python?\n",
        " ->The @property decorator in python is used to defines getter methods that can be accessed like attributes,while still allowing us to include logic behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " ->Polymorphism means \"many forms\"--it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass,enabling flexibility,scalability,and clean code in objects-oriented programming\n",
        "\n",
        "15.what is an abstract class in python?\n",
        "  ->An abstract class in python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
        "  It is designed to be a base class that proviudes a common interface for its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  -> Object-Oriented programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects and classes. it offers many benefits that make it easier to develop,manage,and scale software.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  ->Class Variable shared by all instance of the class.\n",
        "    . defined inside the class,but outside any instance method.\n",
        "    . changing it affects all objects unless overridden at the instance level.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Instance Variable unique to each instance of the class.\n",
        "     .defined using self.inside the__ init__() method or other instance methods.\n",
        "      .changing it affects only that specific object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in python?\n",
        "   ->multiple inheritance is a feature in objects-oriented programming where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. this allows a child to access the attributes and methods of all its parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.explian the purpose of \"__str\"__'and'__repr__\" metohds in python.\n",
        "  -> __str__ called by str(obj)or print(obj)\n",
        "   .meant to return a readable ,user -friendly string.\n",
        "  . focused on what the object is in a human -readale form.\n",

        "  .__REPR__ called by repr(obj) or in the interactive shell.\n",
        "  . focused on debugging and development.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the significance of the 'super()'funcyion in python?\n",
        " ->The super() function in python is used to call methods from a pqarent (or superclass) in a child class. it is most commonly used with inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the singnification of the __del__method in python ?\n",
        " ->The__del__ method in python is a destructor method. it is called when an object is about to be destroyed, usually when there are no more references to the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in python?\n",
        " ->@Staticmethod the method doesn't need access to instance (self) or class(cls)\n",
        "   . you want to create a utility function inside the class for organization.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   .@Classmethod needs to access or modify class-level data.\n",
        "   .you want to create factory methods thats return class instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. how does polymorphism work in python with inheritance?\n",
        "  -> When child classes override methods from a parent class, andyou use a common interface to interact with objects-python dynamically calls the coreect metods at runtime based on the objects class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is metod chaining in python OOP?\n",
        "  -> Method chaining in python OOP is a techique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line.it makes your code cleaner and more readable by forming a \"chain\" of method calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in python?\n",
        "->It gives your class instances the ability to behave like functions,which can be useful for:\n",
